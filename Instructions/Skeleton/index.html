					<p>Smoking is bad for you, being associated with an increased risk of premature death and chronic
						health conditions. Given this, I considered factors that might be associated with increased 
						smoking in different states. I did a bit of background research and I noted was that people
						in certain <a "href =https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6038a2.htm">industries</a> are more likely to smoke.
						With this in mind I investigated if some states were outliers using the industry of production, transportation and 
						material moving as a model since the CDC article mentions production (manufacturing) and transportation specifically. 
						I've also talked with people personally in manufacturing jobs who say they took up smoking as a way to get more breaks, 
						unfortunately.

					<hr>
					<p><strong>West Virginia</strong> is an outlier in this dataset because only 12% of the state 
					is employed in production, transportation, and material moving, but 23% of West Virginians smoke. 
					This isn't that surprising as West Virginia is one of the nation's
					<a "href =http://mountaineernewsservice.com/west-virginia-ranks-among-nations-worst-in-tobacco-use/">worst states for tobacco use</a>
					This may be due to West Virginia being a state with more poverty and less education than is typical in the rest
					of the US, as well as low cigarette taxes. 
					<br>
					<strong>Utah</strong> is an outlier in the opposite direction. The rate of employement in these 
					industries is similar to West Virginia, but a mere 6% of people smoke in the state. This has a large
					part to do with religion, a majority of people in the state identify as member of the Church of Later
					Day Saints(Mormons). Members of the church do not typically use drugs or alcohol and tobacco use
					is culturally frowned upon.</p>
